##  work organization  

   To achieve thoses objectives, i first drew few mock-up with Adobe XD, which gave me an overlook of the design structure.
   Then i did some code in Html / Sass to launch the Webpage, afterwards i wrote the PHP code to get the entered informations.
   For the last part of the project i had to configure PHPMailer and make it work.  It was the most challenging part for me, as the SMTP could not work with my host.
